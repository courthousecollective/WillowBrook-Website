        comment: "Updated homepage hero section with new headline 'We Help Indianapolis Homeowners Sell Fast and Stress-Free'. Added large, urgent CTA button 'Get My Cash Offer â†’' with deep blue background (#1A73E8), white text, large font (20px), proper padding (16px/28px), rounded corners (8px), hover effects (scale 1.03, darker color, enhanced shadow). Button is mobile-responsive and links to the sell page. Enhanced with custom CSS for professional appearance and urgency."
